If you watched the Super Bowl (and ratings numbers suggest you probably did), you might have noticed a flurry of ads for something called Homes.com. In case you don’t know, this is a company under the Costar umbrella that is trying to directly compete with and take market share away from Zillow.&nbsp;

Essentially, their goal is to become a lead aggregator so they can sell those leads to real estate agents. While you may or may not use that service, one thing you can do is pull their housing data reports from their website and add something they cannot: the human element.&nbsp;

**Translating this data into easily understandable language through videos is one of the best things you can do to connect with your database.** Not only does it create engaging content, but it also positions you as an expert in your market that people can trust. When it comes time for these people to buy or sell a home, you’ll be the first person they turn to for help.&nbsp;

If you would like a consultation on how to create video content, please call or email me. I’d love to speak with you!
