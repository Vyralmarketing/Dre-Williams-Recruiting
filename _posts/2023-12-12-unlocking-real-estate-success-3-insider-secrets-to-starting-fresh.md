What are the three things you would do to make sure that you can have speedy success with your real estate business? The market right now feels like it’s a perfect storm—it's a blend of various factors making it challenging to thrive. Some individuals, however, continue to excel in these circumstances. They possess the three key elements essential for success in real estate. I had a conversation with Marc King, President of Keller Williams, who shared what he would prioritize if he were commencing his business now, mirroring the current situation. Here are the three things you need to succeed in today’s market.

**1\. Cultivate a robust database.** It extends beyond your phone contacts, encompassing everyone within your network and consistently expanding your sphere of influence. Your sphere of influence comprises anyone with whom you discuss real estate matters. While conversing solely about real estate 24/7 might not be ideal, discovering an aspect within real estate that genuinely excites you, allowing you to engage for prolonged periods, becomes your unique strength. For instance, I find passion in YouTube and modern marketing, enabling me to advise real estate agents on leveraging these platforms effectively. Identify your own forte that attracts people into your sphere of influence.

**2\. Stay updated on the local market analysis.** Despite advice against posting non-evergreen content, presenting current market information establishes your authority. Understanding market fluctuations and their impacts, such as why certain houses aren’t selling due to price gaps versus interest rates, showcases your expertise. Consistently share this analysis, at least once a week, not just as images but with added context—videos or overlays—to establish your brand and credibility. Remember, educating is more effective than selling.

**3\. Embrace various forms of media.** Instead of relying solely on traditional methods like emails or newspapers, focus on video and social media platforms. Direct traffic from social platforms to YouTube and your website. Mastery of this transition is crucial, and I'm committed to guiding you through it. In January, we have a YouTube summit focusing on the top 20%, while also offering consultations for others. Engaging content should be your focus—80% about you and 20% about work. People seek connection and trust, not just sales pitches. Establish trust, and your business will thrive.

Remember, success in real estate lies in educating and engaging your audience rather than pushing for sales. By mastering these three strategies, you'll pave the way for success in your real estate endeavors. If you need more help with your real estate goals, call or email me. I’m always happy to help.
